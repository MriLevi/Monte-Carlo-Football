# Monte-Carlo-Football
This python program/notebook simulates a simplified football league based on win/draw/loss chance, using a self-implemented Mersenne Twister based on pseudocode found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Algorithmic_detail.

To run, simply open the python notebook in jupyter notebook, and make sure that mersenne_twister.py is located in the same directory.
